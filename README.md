My first serious project that I've created for my programming classes at university. It's a Telegram bot that hints you about possible options of spending your spare time. I was always curious about how do bots work, so I've decided to try it out. The bot itself is not very useful as it only uses info I hardcoded into it, but the development gave me a real-life representation of a programmer work. That's my starting point, I suppose.
